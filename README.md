# Horror mini game project

This is a small First Person Shooter Game with a horror theme . 

Known Issues 
1) The postion of enemies is changing when "Attack Animation" is played .
2) Lookat function needs to be triggered in better way.
3) Problem with ammo count and gun fire .
4) Enemies Dont attack at the camera but beside it , probably asset placement issue in the character controller.

# IMPORTANT
Unfortunately I lost the original source file for this project and I had to decompile my v.1.0 build and so the this repo wont directly work in unity editor but its easy to replicate the scene easily as this contains all neccesary scrips and assets.

To Replicate this project in unity
1) Open this project in unity (Master branch)
2) Open Sample scene
3) Traverse through all the game object and see the attached scripts , animators and other game components
4) Replicate all the things in a new project manually (codes can be copied exactly as it is )
5) Do everything in a serialised manner

   I tried to comment as much as possible and naming convention is also easy to understand.
